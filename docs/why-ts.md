# Why Typescript?

## Front end

I can't see the reason why you choose React/NG but still writing JS if webpack/Rollup is packaging you code.

Elm is pretty fine, but TS makes sharing code between front/back ends possible. The later also makes GraphQL and GRpc worth try. I have to admit that there must someone able to fullfill these with Elm and some backend from Haskell, but I'm sure that's not me.

## Back end

It might be transferred to GRpc in the future. I think TS is a considerate option for prototypes for backend services, since it's flexible but much more reliable than js. The code could be valuable when I have to refactor the whole archtecture.
