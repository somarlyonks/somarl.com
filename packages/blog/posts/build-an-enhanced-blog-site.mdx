## Why Next.js and MDX

The goal is to build a responsive blog site looks nice on laptop/tablet/mobile phone. If you ask me why, it's for fun. Though most blog sites are being unnecessary complicated, there's no better chance to research and practice semantic HTML and typography then building a blog site from scratch.

First of all, this site is a part of my progressive personal site matrix along with [www.somarl.com](https://www.somarl.com) and [moment.somarl.com](https://moment.somarl.com), it makes sense to use a consistent framework.

And, [<NextJS />](https://nextjs.org) is **GREAT**! It covers most of things we had to concern about from coding to deployment.

Then, for blog posts, [<MDXIcon />](https://mdxjs.com) is **SPECTACULAR**! You see, we get an svg in a paragraph, with `[<MDXIcon />](https://mdxjs.com)` in the source of this post. I considered between markdown and LaTex, but the former lacks ability to insert customized components as the later lacks simple but extensible building tools for Web sites and hard to export to other platforms. I even thoughted about manually writing HTMLs. MDX wiped all my concerns.


## What I did to build this site

To work with Next.js, I chose [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) as the adapter for MDX posts and build the basic workspace structure under their instructions.

```
blog
├── posts
│   └── hello.mdx
├── public
│   └── images
│       └── hello
│           └── cover.jpg
└── src
    ├── components
    ├── lib
    ├── styles
    └── pages
        └── post
            └── [slug].tsx
```

In `src/pages/post/[slug].tsx` we build the mdx files in `posts` like

```tsx
import {postFileSlugsSync, serializePost} from 'src/lib'

export default function PostPage ({compiledSource, scope}) {
    return (
        <article>
            <MDXRemote compiledSource={compiledSource} scope={scope} />
        </article>
    )
}

export const getStaticProps = async ({params: {slug}}) => {
    const {compiledSource, scope} = await serializePost(slug)

    return {
        props: {
            compiledSource,
            scope,
        },
    }
}

export const getStaticPaths = async ctx => {
    return {
        paths: postFileSlugsSync.map(slug => ({
            params: {
                slug,
            },
        })),
        fallback: false,
    }
}
```

It makes everthing work. We enhance it from here. First of all, style the post rendered.

Let's first check some details of the basic components supported in markdown. How do they look like and what I did with them.

## Headings

I added the heading anchor like Github with the help of [remark-slug](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-slug) and [remark-autolink-headings](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-autolink-headings).

Try hover on the headings if you are viewing this post by a device with a pointer on screen and the anchors will show up.

## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

## And let's just try and see how does a very loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong heading looks like

## Inline texts

There are _emphasis_, **strong** and ~~strikethrough~~.

And we have <abbr title="Example for abbr">ABBR</abbr> styled as small caps.

## Thematic break

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Both code block and inline code use the background color as Github markdown code blocks.

The issue was about how to implement syntax highlighting. There are choices like `highlightjs` and `prism` but I chose a syntax highlighter called ["shiki"](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki).

The reason is simple, it does syntax parsing and apply TextMate rules like text editors(VS Code, for example), that's what I call "highlighting". A simple thing explains what does it mean - it highlights `mdx` files without any extra configurations.

The only thing I needed to do is to find a proper remark plugin, it turned out to be [@stefanprobst/remark-shiki](https://github.com/stefanprobst/remark-shiki).

### Code block

```js
// Sample javascript code
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
# Sample python code
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

We will see much more code blocks in this post, let's leave it here.

### Inline code

`Inline code` looks like this.

## List

Simply style them and then

- Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  - Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Task lists included.

- [x] nested unordered lists
- [x] ordered lists
- [x] task lists
- [ ] nested task lists

Some thing worth mentioning is that MDX render task list item into

```html
<li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /> task lists</li>
```

The problem is `disabled`, I don't like its grey accent color in most broswers ;(

So I overrided the customized component like, though `readOnly` does not make any sense here :)

```jsx
export default function PostLi ({children}: IProps) {
    if (Array.isArray(children)) {
        const [checkbox, ...restChildren] = children
        if (isValidElement(checkbox) && checkbox.props.type === 'checkbox') return (
            <li>
                <input type="checkbox" checked={checkbox.props.checked} readOnly />
                {restChildren}
            </li>
        )
    }

    return <li>{children}</li>
}
```

Yet another interesting thing to metion is that task lists selected as `ul.contains-task-list` was the only class name used through out the whole site style sheets. I overrided it as `ul[role="listbox"]` to avoid this.

## Images

The image syntax in markdown is like `![alt](src)` or `![alt](src "title")`. I'd like to display the title as caption if present.

On default, MDX transform `![alt](src "title")` to

```jsx
<img src={src} alt={alt} title={title} />
```

Which means the title is almost not working, even Google spiders ignore `title` attribute in images. So, I decided to use the `figure` element to render images which has `figcaption` suitable for the title.

Then I need to override the default component in `MDXRemote` with a custom `PostImage` react component like

```tsx
export default function PostImage ({src, alt, title}) {
    return (
        <figure>
            <img src={src} alt={alt} title={title} />
            <figcaption>{title}</figcaption>
        </figure>
    )
}
```

And pass them to the `MDXRemote` like

```tsx
import PostImage from 'src/components/PostImage'

const components = {
    img: PostImage
}

<MDXRemote compiledSource={compiledSource} scope={scope} components={components} />
```

Unfortunately, content in mdx like below

```markdown
![Placeholder image](http://placehold.it/800x400)

![Image with caption](http://placehold.it/500x300 "Image with caption")
```

will be rendered into

```html
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="http://placehold.it/800x400" alt="Placeholder image">
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    <figure>
        <img
            src="http://placehold.it/500x300"
            alt="Image with caption"
            title="Image with caption"
        >
        <figcaption>Image with caption</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
```

The problem is that `p` elements only accept inline elements (more precisely, [phrasing contents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#phrasing_content)) as children, which means put a `figure` in `p` might cause unpredictable behaviors.

The solution is to unwrap the images with a remark plugin called [remark-unwrap-images](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-unwrap-images).

It makes sense to put figures directly into articles. Then we style it like

```scss
article {
    figure {
        text-align: center;
    }
    figcaption {
        font-size: 0.85em;
        opacity: 50%;
    }
}
```

and it looks like below

![Placeholder image](http://placehold.it/800x400)

![Image with caption](http://placehold.it/500x300 "Image with caption")

## Table

Take the [tabel of components](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components) from MDX document as an example.

It has a sticky header, try scroll around the table. It's really tricky to style a responsive table, maybe we can talk about the details later.

| Tag | Name      | Syntax |
|:----|:----------|:-------|
|p    | Paragraph |        |
|h1   | Heading 1 | `#`      |
|h2   | Heading 2 | `##`     |
|h3   | Heading 3 | `###`    |
|h4   | Heading 4 | `####`   |
|h5   | Heading 5 | `#####`  |
|h6   | Heading 6 | `######` |
|blockquote|Blockquote|	`> `|
|ul|List|`- `|
|ol|Ordered list|`1. `|
|li|List item||
|table|Table||
|thead|Table head||
|tbody|Table body||
|tr|Table row||
|td/th|Table cell||
|code|Code|<code>\`\`\`code\`\`\`</code>|
|inlineCode|InlineCode|<code>\`inlineCode\`</code>|
|pre|Code|<code>\`\`\`code\`\`\`</code>|
|em|Emphasis|`_emphasis_`|
|strong|Strong|`**strong**`|
|del|Delete|`~~strikethrough~~`|
|hr|Thematic break|`---` or `***`|
|a|Link|`<https://mdxjs.com>` or `[MDX](https://mdxjs.com)`|
|img|Image|`![alt](https://mdx-logo.now.sh)`|

## Blockquote

MDX makes blockquote footer easier to apply, it just takes a little tricks in styling and then

```mdx
> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
>
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
> <footer>Lorem Ipsum<cite>Lorem Ipsum</cite></footer>
```

turns out to be like

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
>
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
> <footer>Lorem Ipsum<cite>Lorem Ipsum</cite></footer>

That's all about typography by now.

## Things left

There are things confirmed to do

- language categoried
- post last modified time track
- post viewing track and analysis
- AWS S3 for attached static files

And there are features worth considering

- preferred light/dark theme
- full text search
- post series
- locale and translation

Some of them are definitely to be implemented in the coming weeks and this post will be updated as things are done.
